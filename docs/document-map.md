# Document Map

This document is the location-and-timing map for the framework's major documents.
Use `docs/feature-flow-overview.md` when you want the lifecycle flow.
Use this document when you want to find the right file quickly and understand when it should be created, updated, and referenced.

Path notation is based on an installed project by default.
When checking this repository itself, map `.cowork/...` paths to `frameworks/ko/.cowork/...`.

## Update Policy

Update this document when the framework document layout changes in a meaningful way:

- a major document or directory is added, removed, renamed, or moved
- the normal creation point of a document changes
- the default reference order changes for a phase or workflow
- a document changes role between governance, canonical, registry, instance, template, or log

Do not update it for routine content edits inside the mapped documents.

## Reading Order

1. Start with the tool entrypoint, `.cowork/06_evolution/project_state.md`, `.cowork/02_project_definition/deliverable_plan.md`, the relevant `.cowork/members/<name>/workspace/my_state.md`, and the latest relevant session log.
2. Use `.cowork/cowork.md` and other governance documents on the first session or when workflow rules need clarification.
3. Move into the current phase's registry and canonical documents before opening instance documents.
4. Open instance documents only for the active `INT-*`, `US-*`, `ADR-*`, `MS-*`, or `TASK-*` items.
5. Treat templates, imported context, proposals, and older logs as on-demand material rather than default reading.

## Boundary Note

This document maps the installed framework and its published entrypoints.
Repository maintainer documents such as the root `README.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and release scripts stay outside this map unless they directly change the framework contract.
