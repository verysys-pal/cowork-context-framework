# Export Specification

> Source document that defines official deliverable generation rules and source-document mapping

---

## Purpose

`.cowork/` is the set of **shared source documents for working sessions**.
`docs/` is the set of **official delivery documents**.

This document defines the **source-document interpretation rules** and **generation methods** used to create official documents from the cowork source documents
when a project or phase is completed.

---

## Operating Boundary

- This document defines **which source documents to read and how to generate from them**.
- The active target list, approval state, and missing data for actual deliverables follow `02_project_definition/deliverable_plan.md`.
- The final set of official deliverables is the sum of the active default recommended 14 items plus any Human-approved extension deliverables (15+) in `deliverable_plan.md`.

---

## Export Philosophy

The goal of official deliverable generation in this framework is **better traceable official documents**, not rigid format cloning.

### Invariant Rules

- Every official deliverable must be traceable back to the cowork source documents that support it.
- Do not omit required sections, key decisions, major constraints, or unresolved risks.
- If the source documents are incomplete, do not hide that. Mark it as `Not written` or `Undecided`.
- If the AI uses inference, keep it separate from confirmed facts under labels such as `Assumption`, `Inference`, or `Needs Additional Confirmation`.

### AI Discretion

- The AI may rearrange section order, table layout, and explanation depth to improve readability.
- It may consolidate repeated content or explain the relationship between multiple source documents more clearly.
- As AI quality improves, it may attempt more polished synthesis and explanation.
- That discretion must never break the invariant rules or source-document traceability.

---

## Source Priority

Use the following priority when interpreting source documents for official deliverable generation.

1. approved canonical documents
2. registry + instance combinations
3. approved ADRs
4. latest session log
5. imported context

- `templates/*_template.md` are not source documents for official deliverable generation.
- `session_logs/` and `imported_context/` are supporting evidence only when higher-priority source documents are empty.
- Imported context should be promoted into canonical / registry / instance documents first whenever possible.

## Default Recommended 14 Deliverable Mapping

> This table defines the standard source documents and generation method for the default recommended 14 deliverables.
> Real generation still follows the `Required / Recommended / Not Applicable` decision and approval state in `deliverable_plan.md`.

## Extension Deliverables (15+) Interpretation

- Only Human-approved items registered in `deliverable_plan.md` -> `Extension Deliverables (15+)` are included in official deliverable generation.
- The number, title, and core data source documents for an extension deliverable are confirmed through `deliverable_plan.md`.
- Use `Direct` for a single canonical document, `Synthesis` for multiple source documents, and the registry + instance rule when that structure applies.
- If the extension can be absorbed into one of the default 14 deliverables, prefer integration over creating an unnecessary separate official document.

---

## Generation Method Definitions

### Direct

Organize the content of a cowork source document into official-document form and write it into `docs/`.

- remove template guide comments (`<!-- -->`)
- add document number, version, and approval header
- generate a table of contents when helpful
- allow section reordering, deduplication, and wording improvements
- specify the source documents used in the header or references section
- separate unconfirmed content into `Assumption` or `Needs Additional Confirmation`

### Synthesis

Combine multiple cowork source documents into one official document.

- When several source documents are combined, preserve traceability of which document contributed which content.
- The AI may propose a better explanation structure, but must not add unsupported detail as if it were confirmed fact.

### Registry + Instance Rule

- Use the registry as the baseline for lists, status, priority, and links.
- Use instance documents as the source for detail explanation, decision basis, or individual work plans.
- For WBS generation, start from `milestone_registry.md` and `task_registry.md`, and expand `tasks/TASK-*.md` only when deeper explanation is needed.
- For architecture generation, read `adr_registry.md` together with `adrs/ADR-*.md` and reflect only approved decisions into the body.

## Generation Timing

| Timing | Target | Trigger |
|------|--------|--------|
| Phase completed | deliverables related to that phase | after the Quality Gate passes |
| Project completed | active default 14 deliverables + approved extension deliverables (15+) | Human says `release` |
| On demand | individual document | Human request |
